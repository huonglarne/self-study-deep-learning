# Self study Deep Learning

Self studying neural network construction with Tensorflow. The textbook I am using is Deep Learning with Python by Fran√ßois Chollet.

## Chapter 2

Study the operations behind neural networks, including matrix operations, gradient descent and back propagation.

Code: multiclass classification.

Dataset: MNIST hand written digits.

## Chapter 3

Study the core components of a neural network including basic activation functions, optimizer, loss functions and validation metrics.

Learn about overfitting and how to fix it using k-fold cross validation and analyzing the metrics.

Code: binary classification and regression

Dataset: IMDB sentiment and Boston housing prices.
